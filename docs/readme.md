# Replication files 

All of the data and code required to reproduce the figures in the body and suppliments are available on the github repository for the `netlit` package (github.com/judgelord/netlit) as described below. Because live package vignettes may change in the future, we have archived submission versions of the data in `/data/` and submission versions of the vignettes in `/docs/`.
