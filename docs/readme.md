# Replication files 

This document is available online at https://judgelord.github.io/netlit/readme

All of the data and code required to reproduce the figures in the body and supplements are available on the github repository for the `netlit` package ([github.com/judgelord/netlit](https://judgelord.github.io/netlit/)) as described below. 
Clone a copy of all replication data and code on the command line with: 

```git clone github.com/judgelord/netlit```

The package will soon be on CRAN. Until then, install the package in R: 

```devtools::install_github("judgelord/netlit")```

Because live package vignettes may change in the future, we have archived submission versions of the data in `/replication_data/` and submission versions of the vignettes in `/docs/`.
